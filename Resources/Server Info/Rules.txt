[color=#ff3f00]0.[/color] Enforcement of these rules is at the discretion of admins.
    - Admins are fully accountable for any consequences should they invoke this rule. Admins are also allowed to intervene in rounds when it is in the best interest of the playerbase.

[color=#a4885c]1.[/color] Don't be a dick.
    - We're all here to have a good time, supposedly. Going out of your way to seriously negatively impact or end the round for someone with little IC justification is against the rules, this also includes harassing a player OOC (Out of character). Legitimate conflicts where people get upset do happen however, as detailed in the escalation section of the rules.

[color=#a4885c]2.[/color] Do not use information gained outside of in-character means.
    - I.e. metagaming. This especially refers to communication between players outside of the game via things like Discord, known as metacomms. Characters are otherwise allowed to know everything about ingame mechanics or antagonists, as well as keep persistent friendships or relationships with other characters when not for the purpose of unfair advantage by teaming up together for little IC reason.

[color=#a4885c]3.[/color] Do not say in character (IC) things in the out of character (OOC) chat channel.
    - Do not say OOC things in IC either. There is an exception for OOC in IC where terms like 'clickdrag X to Y, or look for the tab' is used to help a player.

[color=#a4885c]4.[/color] Lone antagonists can do whatever they want.
    - Except metagaming/comms, bug/exploit abuse, erotic/creepy stuff, OOC in IC or IC in OOC, and spawn-camping arrivals. Team antagonists can do whatever they want as per lone antagonists, as long as it doesn’t harm their team. Non-antagonists can do whatever they want to antagonists as per lone antagonists, but non-antagonists are not allowed to pre-emptively search for, hinder or otherwise seek conflict with antagonists without reasonable prior cause. Non-antags acting like an antag can be treated as an antag.

[color=#a4885c]5.[/color] Players in a head of staff or a team conversion role require a minimum amount of effort; generally considered to be not logging out at or near roundstart.
    - Notify admins if you cannot play these roles and must leave near round start and make an attempt to inform other players IC as well for head of staff or AI roles. Abuse of a job position, particularly Rule 1 breaking abuse, is not allowed.

[color=#a4885c]6.[/color] In-game administration rulings are final.
    - Incidences of admin abuse, negligence or disputed rulings can be taken to the discord. If an admin says something was 'looked into, handled, resolved' etc, regarding an issue, it is unlikely an admin will provide any further information. Admins are under no obligation to reveal IC information. Deliberately lying or misrepresenting facts in adminhelps will be dealt with harshly.

[color=#a4885c]7.[/color] If you regularly come close to breaking the rules without actually breaking them, it will be treated as the rules being broken.
    - Repeated instances of the same rules being broken may be met with harsher consequences. Baiting people into situations where you can report them to admins will be dealt with harshly.

[color=#a4885c]8.[/color] Erotic/creepy stuff is not allowed.
    - [color=#ff0000]No form of erotic roleplay is allowed on the servers,[/color] including things that could be construed as sexual by unwilling participants.

[color=#a4885c]9.[/color] Players need to be the age of 18 or above.
    - This rule is for the benefit of and is meant to protect people who shouldn't be playing here due to the nature of the SS14 community. Your age won't be hunted down, but if you admit it to us in admin PMs, or other places within the community, you're getting banned.

[color=#a4885c]10.[/color] Losing is part of the game.
    - Your character will frequently die, sometimes without even a possibility of avoiding it. Events will often be out of your control. No matter how good or prepared you are, sometimes you just lose.

[color=#a4885c]11.[/color] Bigotry is not allowed.
    - Intentionally seeking to demean others due to their actual or perceived race, sex, gender, disability, orientation or the like is not tolerated. It is not our goal to create or enforce a list of banned words and instead our goal to eject the expression of bigotry from the community. Enforcement will be less PC based and more common sense based with that goal in mind.
    - This means rather than warning or banning for quoting a usage such as "Griff McNazi got banned for calling somebody a faggot" or even things like "nigga pls" and "what are you faggots playing" which are generally not statements made to be bigoted, we'll focus more on statements like "you talk like a \[insert stereotype]" or "x is a \[insert slur]".

[color=#a4885c]12.[/color] This is a sandbox roleplaying game.
    - The purpose of the game is to have fun roleplaying. Play-to-win gameplay that ruins the purpose of the game at the expense of others is against the rules.


Escalation Policy

As a non-antagonist you may begin conflict with another player with valid reason (refusal of critical services, belligerent attitude, etc) OR if it does not excessively interfere with their ability to do their job. Whomever you engage is entitled to respond to your actions. If the conflict leads to violence and you had a poor reason for causing conflict in the first place, you may face administrative action.

If you are wronged, you are expected to handle the conflict non-lethally whenever possible, escalating in severity as the conflict continues. As the defending party the rate of escalation increases with you, up to and including violence, while the instigator is always able to respond in kind.

If a conflict leads to violence and either participant is incapacitated, the standing participant is expected to make an effort to treat the other, unless they have reason to believe the other was an antagonist. Once treated the conflict is over; any new conflict with either individual must escalate once again. If you get into a conflict again with that individual, they may be removed permanently from the round.


Non-Antagonists Resisting Arrest

Non-antagonists should not harmfully resist or retaliate against valid arrests, but do not have to simply give up and allow the arrest to happen. They may instead non-harmfully escape or avoid the arresting officer in the spirit of the game.

If an arrest is not obviously valid, it follows standard escalation. Resisting or retaliating against arrests without good reason may break Escalation Policy and be handled administratively. Non-antagonist players may lose any OOC and IC protections if they choose this path and should consider ahelping if they believe they did nothing to warrant being arrested.

In resisting arrest, non-antagonists should not loot officers and should not detain or incapacitate officers any longer than is necessary to escape or explain themselves.

[color=#ff0000]MRP Specific Rules[/color]

[color=#a4885c]14.[/color] This server is a "Roleplay Expected" server. We define this as performing your assigned duties, "doing your job". This means it is important to do what is expected out of your department and not what would be expected out of other departments.
    - Don’t do other peoples jobs for them. Opt in for the role you intend to play or change your job by visiting the Head of Personnel. Failure to do your basic duties may result in a job ban.

[color=#a4885c]15.[/color] Each round exists independently of all other rounds. While friendships persisting through rounds is okay, using experiences from other rounds to give an advantage or disadvantage to other players is not permitted.

[color=#a4885c]16.[/color] New Life Rule is in effect - Do not use information obtained while dead or from a previous life upon returning to the land of the living. Even if you are cloned, you do not remember the events culminating in your death.

[color=#a4885c]17.[/color] Do your best not to interact negatively with SSD/AFK players. Moving them to safety is acceptable; killing, looting, or otherwise griefing them while they are away is not.
    - SSD characters are players who are disconnected or AFK. It is possible for players to return to SSD bodies. Players become catatonic when they take a ghost spawner role or commit suicide. Players are NOT able to return to these bodies without admin intervention.
    - If the player in question is an antag’s target or they are being secured by security, interactions to finish what is required of your duties/objectives are always acceptable.
    - Ahelping about an SSD/AFK player may grant an exception to this rule.
    - This does not apply to players that are catatonic, although needlessly killing or harming catatonic players is discouraged.

[color=#a4885c]18.[/color] As mentioned above, [color=#ff0000]Space Law, Standard Operating Procedure and Alert Procedure policy/guidelines are expected to be adhered to[/color]. These can be found at wiki.spacestation14.io.

[color=#ff0000]Command Rules[/color]

[color=#a4885c]19.[/color] The following jobs: Captain, HOP, HOS, CE, RD, CMO, and QM should ahelp when they need to stop playing. Do not play these roles if you do not expect to be able to finish the round.
    - These roles must exhibit some competency. Incompetence can result in a job ban. Command roles are designed to lead and manage departments first and do second. They are not intended to become do-it-all members of their departments.
    - Crew promoted to acting heads of staff must step down when an official head of staff arrives at the station. This is to prevent confusion with the chain of command when the new player arrives.

[color=#a4885c]20.[/color] In the absence of a captain, the Head of Personnel must serve as acting captain. In the absence of a captain or HoP, the other command staff should choose an acting captain by consensus, in accordance with the Standard Operating Procedure.
    - Only command staff may serve as acting captain. Acting departmental heads and regular crew may not serve as acting captain.
    - An acting captain may fill in for decisions that require the captain’s authorization, but may not run the station and its departments, nor are they privy to the captain’s equipment or access, with exceptions for the command headset and nuke disk.

[color=#ff0000]Antagonist and Ghost Role Policy[/color]

[color=#a4885c]21.[/color] Antagonists exist to move the round forward and make things interesting and fun for everyone involved. The point isn't to "win", kill everyone else, or anything like that.
    - Do not spawn camp or prevent others from entering the round safely.
    - Do what is needed for your goals. Causing chaos in a department with a bomb is okay, but destroying half the station when you only need to steal magboots is an example of going extremely overboard.
    - Team antag objectives take precedence over solo antag objectives.
    - Ghost spawner roles must follow their flavor text upon taking said role.

[color=#ff0000]Escalation Rules[/color]

    - Self-defense is always allowed, to the extent of saving your own life. Preemptively attacking/maiming someone or hitting someone while they are already incapacitated is not considered self-defense.
    - Minor conflicts and scuffles are allowed, given that the wronged party has reasonable justification. If you are wronged, you are expected to handle the conflict non-lethally whenever possible, escalating in severity as the conflict continues.
    - As the defending party the rate of escalation increases with you, up to and including violence, while the instigator is always able to respond in kind.
    - If a conflict leads to violence and either participant is incapacitated, the standing participant is expected to make an effort to treat the other or ensure medbay treats them, unless they have reason to believe the other was an antagonist.
    - Once treated the conflict is over; any new conflict with either individual must escalate once again. If you get into a conflict again with that individual, they may be removed permanently from the round.
    - Not all conflicts should be solved in character. If a non-antagonist conflict has escalated to the point of interfering with the round in a detrimental way, Admin Help is preferred as a solution.
    - If you’re unsure whether escalation is justified in a given conflict, don’t be afraid to use Admin Help and ask for clarification.

[color=#ff0000]Admin Interactions[/color]

    - Use ahelp (admin help) to send the admins a message when someone is breaking the rules, or a problem has occured and you need assistance.
    - Do not use ahelp to complain, or if the problem can be solved in-character.
    - When sending an ahelp, be polite and do not lie. When using ahelp to describe a situation, provide as many details as you can, such as names of people involved.
    - When getting an ahelp from an admin, take the message seriously and respond in a timely manner.
    - An admin's word is law—follow it, don't argue it. If you think an admin is acting unfairly or otherwise abusing their position, you can file an admin complaint with the head administrator through Discord.
